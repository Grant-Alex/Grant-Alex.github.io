                    This project was done for my Gaming Development class in my junior year of college along with two other students. This project marked my first complete game development project and had a heavy focus on being a contained and finished project. The main idea was to make a top-down survival shooter, like games such as the Killingfloor franchise and older web games such as SAS: Zombie Assault. The project itself was created over a weeklong Game Jam with a game theme of "infestation". With knowledge of this limited development time beforehand, time was able to be spent figuring out what type of game would be made as well as what was necessary to succeed within the timeframe.

                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this project, I had also set the personal goal of creating all the assets myself, and besides for the weapons, the shader used in the shop, the music, and sound effects, as well as the enemies, everything else was created and animated by me. A basic but good-sized map was created for the player, allowing for variation between waves without exceeding the time allotted for the part. Enemy spawn points were obfuscated using "shadows", as this was a way to make it so that enemies did not pop randomly out of the air without the requirement of making additional animations.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The player themselves were easily the most complex part of the entire project. This included on the asset development front as well, with the amount of time dedicated to the creation of the player model and its animations taking triple the desired amount. Besides that, development of the player mechanics went smoothly, with the playing being tracked during gameplay to present a survival time and score after their demise. The player was also given a suit of weapons with varying stats, starting off with a combat knife and a couple of healing items. With this, the basics of the game were able to be established, along with other aesthetics to improve upon a player’s experience.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shop was a key element of the game that didn’t have any development done on it until the last 24 hours, with there being thoughts of scrapping it entirely. Luckily, I managed to throw together a shop that I am quite proud of, with both the exterior and interior being satisfactory. All upgrade options were also given functionality in time, allowing for the player to see progress in their weapons as they play.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, as my first game I was incredibly happy with what was accomplished. I managed to learn a lot in almost all aspect of game development, while also managing to release something that felt extremely competent despite some parts being rough around the edges. The final gameplay loop was also a source of pride, as weapon upgrades were fun to get, and had an immediate and noticeable effect on gameplay, pushing me to want to play more. Despite this being for a class's 7-day game jam, the concept is one that excited me, and I personally hope to get the opportunity to develop the game or one similar to its fullest potential.
