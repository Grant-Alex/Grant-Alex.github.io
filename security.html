                    Spartian Security was a password managed created for my Software Engineering class along with 3 other students. 
                    The original goal of the project was to create a password manager a la Bitwarden or LastPass.
                    This provided to be a unique challenge as the concepts required for a password manager were new to all of us. 
                    To make sure that the project stayed productive throughout its development lifecycle, tasks were split up among the members.
                    It was mainly split up into four parts, the login logout functionality, user management of the password list, app and plugin functionality, 
                    and security for that application. My job was getting the user management of the password list up and working. This involved things such as
                    being able to add, remove, and edit things such as usernames, passwords, and notes, as well as exporting or importing a password list.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above can be seen the culmination of what I managed to accomplish during the full development time.
                    On a basic level everything that was wanted was able to be developed. Any existing accounts tied to a user is fetched from 
                    our cloud based database of choice, MongoDB, and if they wish to add or delete any accounts, the database will update to reflect this.
                    Each account in the list has the basic necessary features, such as the website the account belongs to, the username and password of the
                    account, as well as an option to write down any other notes needed about the site. The username, password, and note can be copied or edited at 
                    will, and the password is kept hidden to prevent anyone nearby to the user from seeing it. The import and export features also got basic functionality,
                    with the user being able to export their account list by converting the accounts database into a text file. Import worked the exact same in the oppisite order, 
                    taking a text file and converting it to a database. Import was also given basic checks such as making sure the file was valid as well as checking for duplicates.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of development time, a good prototype for what could be was able to be created. Logging in and logging out
                    had the very basics to be used in conjunction with adding and remove passwords from an account, and even had other small features such as a password
                    generator. Other features, however, were unable to be added. There was no app or extention component to the software, though an extention would later be
                    made when some group members continued to develope the project as a senior project, and while researched had been done, security was nonexistent. Overall, the
                    project was a good lesson in managing expectation, as well as figuring out how to assign jobs among members based on their strengths and weaknesses, and despite
                    not meeting the original goal, a significant amount of progress was made.
