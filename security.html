                    I'm a passionate software developer who recently earned their bachelor's degree in computer science.
                    I love exploring new and experimental software and managed to do a lot during my time at The Wentworth Institute of Technology.
                    Over the years I got to study everything from Game Development to Data Analysis using Machine Learning.
                    I also worked on a multitude of projects, covering topics such as game, mobile, and web development, as well as Machine Learning and Image Processing. 
                    Most of these projects can be found on the sidebar.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, degree in hand, I am currently working on my own projects while looking at new technologies to try out, with my current goal being to broaden my horizens in the game development field. 
                    With bigger game engines such as Unreal creating things such as Lumen and Nanite, and smaller engines such as Godot overhauling their engine to rival ones such as Unity, there has never been a better time to be in the game development field.
