                        This was a project done for my AI for Gaming class in my senior year of college with another student of the class. Being my second game development project, as well as it being for
                        an AI class, my focus was trying to work with as many foreign concepts as I could. The main idea was to make a rogue-like dungeon crawler, similar to existing games such as Enter the Gungeon or Nuclear Throne.
                        This would allow my partner and I to focuse on topics such as Procedual Generation and AI.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first main chunk, the procedual generation, was mainly handled by my partner while I helped with bugfixing as well as some cleanup. This was easily the most complicated part of the project, and we both spent many hours trying to figure out how to get it to work "Properly". Room generation was fairly straightforward, with there always being a start and exit generated, with other rooms being added randomly to provide replayability. However, one fatal error that we made during development was that the generation of the rooms and the generation of the hallways was kept completely seperate. This lead to our hallway generation, in a sense, being forced to tip toe around our rooms, causing a lot of additional code to be required for cleanup to make the hallways actually navagatable.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other part of the project was the creation of an AI that could adiquetly navagate though our procedually generated dungeon, along with interacting with the player in a way that was fun and natural. I had a lot of fun with this, as besides the odd state machine lab for the class, I had never made any sort of video game AI on this level. To keep the AI on a level that can realistically be done in the span of a semester, I limited development of the AI to only have primitive behaviors. Below a breakdown of the AI can be seen, where the AI behaviors were limited to idling, wandering, chasing the player, and attacking the player. With these 4 basic behaviors, a simple but interesting AI was created while maintaining the limited scope of the project.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall this was a project filled with learning and new experinces. If you want to try out what was created, you can play the web build or download the exacutable at the top of the page. Also note that the web build is very rough and may not work thanks to weird unity quirks and the fact that this was absolutely not built for the web.
