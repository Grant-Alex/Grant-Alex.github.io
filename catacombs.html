                        This was a project done for my AI for Gaming class in my senior year of college with another student of the class. Being my second game development project, my focus was trying to work with as many foreign concepts as I could. The main idea was to make a rogue-like dungeon crawler, similar to existing games such as Enter the Gungeon or Nuclear Throne.
                        This would allow my partner and I to focus on topics such as Procedural Generation and AI.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first major part of the project was the ability to procedurally create a dungeon at will. To do so, the generation was split into two parts. The first part was the generation of the rooms themselves. These rooms were made before hand and were randomly placed in ways to make sure that no two rooms would overlap. The second part was connecting these rooms using hallways. This was accomplished by connecting all the rooms together, and then finding the shortest path possible that would go through every room. From there a hallway would be built on top of this path, allowing the player to traverse between rooms.

                </p>
                <p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other part of the project was the creation of an AI that could adequately navigate through our procedurally generated dungeon and with interacting with the player in a way that was fun and natural. I had a lot of fun with this. I had never made any sort of video game AI on this level. To keep the AI on a level that can realistically be done in the span of a semester, I limited development of the AI to only have primitive behaviors. The following image shows a breakdown of the AI. The AI's behaviors were limited to idling, wandering, chasing the player, and attacking the player. With these 4 basic behaviors, a simple but interesting AI was created while maintaining the limited scope of the project.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, this was a project filled with learning and new experiences. If you want to try out what was created, you can play the web build or download the executable at the top of the page. Also note that the web build is very rough and may not work as it was not originally created with a web build in mind.
